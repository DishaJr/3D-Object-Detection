# 3D-Object-Detection
Midterm second course in the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program.

## **Task :**
When the code is functional, you are supposed to use the viewer to locate and closely inspect point-clouds on vehicles and write a short report that includes the following items:
* Find and display 10 examples of vehicles with varying degrees of visibility in the point-cloud
* Identify vehicle features that appear as a stable feature on most vehicles (e.g. rear-bumper, tail-lights) and describe them briefly. Also, use the range image viewer from the last example to underpin your findings using the lidar intensity channel.
